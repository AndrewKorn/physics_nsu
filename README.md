# Here are collected physics assignments that were solved by me and my classmates in the second year of the second semester.


## biprisma_intensity:
modeling the behavior of light waves passing through the Fresnel biprism and plotting the light intensity

## biprisma_heatmap:
investigation of the probability of finding imaginary light sources in the Fresnel biprism problem

## particle_in_finite_hole:
modeling the behavior of a quantum particle in a finite potential well. Construction of energy levels and corresponding wave functions
